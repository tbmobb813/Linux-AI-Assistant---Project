## Troubleshooting

Snap vs system terminal (important)

- If you run the development workflow from a terminal provided by a snap-packaged app (for example the VS Code snap), the Snap runtime can inject its own shared libraries (under `/snap/core20/...`) into processes. That can cause symbol lookup errors when running native binaries built against the system libraries (for example: "undefined symbol: \_\_libc_pthread_init, version GLIBC_PRIVATE").
- Workaround: run `npm run tauri dev` or execute the built binary from a normal system terminal (gnome-terminal, xterm, konsole) â€” not from a snap-wrapped terminal. This ensures the system loader uses your distribution's libraries.

Quick commands (system terminal):

```zsh
cd '/media/nixstation-remote/Dev Storage/Projects/Linux AI Assistant - Project/linux-ai-assistant'
# Start dev server + Tauri
npm run tauri dev
```

If you must run from a snap-wrapped environment, try a sanitized environment (may not always work):

```zsh
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="/usr/bin:/bin" DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" \
 DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" XAUTHORITY="$XAUTHORITY" \
 bash --noprofile --norc -c "npm run tauri dev"
```

Note: the most reliable approach is to use a non-snap terminal for building and running native desktop apps.
