# Show HN: Linux AI Assistant (L.A.I.A.) — Privacy-first desktop + CLI for Linux devs [Public Beta]

We’re beta-testing L.A.I.A., a Linux-native AI assistant focused on developer workflows.

Highlights:

- Desktop (Tauri) + CLI, works with your terminal
- Git- and project-aware context (file watcher)
- Privacy-first: local SQLite, no telemetry; optional local models

- Beta info (install, feedback forms): docs/beta/

Looking for feedback on real-world dev use: logs, diffs, snippets; packaging across distros; and CLI/desktop stability. Thanks!
