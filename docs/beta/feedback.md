# L.A.I.A. Beta Feedback

Thanks for testing! Here’s how to give high-quality feedback that helps us improve quickly.

## Channels

- GitHub Issues (preferred)
  - Bug Report form
  - Feature Request form
  - Beta Feedback form (general notes)
- GitHub Discussions (if enabled) for broader topics

## What to include

- For bugs:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Logs or screenshots (redact secrets)
  - Environment:
    - Distro/version (Ubuntu/Fedora/etc.)
    - Desktop environment (GNOME/KDE/other)
    - Kernel version (`uname -r`)
    - App version (release tag)
    - Provider/model in use
- For feature requests:
  - Your use case / problem
  - What you tried today and why it falls short
  - Minimal proposal (start small); alternatives considered
- For general feedback:
  - What’s working well
  - Top 1-2 pain points
  - Your workflow context (languages, editors, tools)

## Triage and priorities

We’ll prioritize issues that:

- Affect many users or common workflows
- Cause crashes/data loss
- Block packaging/install
- Have clear reproduction steps and environment info

## Privacy

No telemetry is collected. Please avoid sharing secrets in logs.

## Next steps

- v1.1 will focus on quick wins (rich chat editing, hotkeys/UI, token tracking, search, window position, PDF export)
- v1.2 will focus on developer power features (command virtualization, deep file/document integration)

Thank you for shaping the roadmap with real-world feedback!
