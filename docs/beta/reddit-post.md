Title: Linux AI Assistant (L.A.I.A.) — Privacy-first desktop + CLI for Linux devs [Public Beta]

We’re launching a public beta of L.A.I.A., a Linux-native AI assistant focused on developer workflows.

Why it’s different:

- Linux-first desktop app (Tauri) + CLI
- Privacy-first, local SQLite; optional local models
- Git- and project-aware context; file watcher
- Works with your terminal and editor-centered workflow

Try it:

- Repo: https://github.com/tbmobb813/Linux-AI-Assistant---Project
- Releases: https://github.com/tbmobb813/Linux-AI-Assistant---Project/releases
- How-to test + feedback: docs/beta/

Looking for feedback on:

- Real workflows (logs, diffs, snippets)
- Packaging/install across distros/DEs
- CLI + desktop stability

No telemetry. Providers are opt-in. Offline/local models supported.

Happy to answer questions in the comments. Thanks!
